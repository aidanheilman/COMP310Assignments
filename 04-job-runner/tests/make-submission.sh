# COMP 310 - Week 4 - build the zip you hand in.
#
# THIS FILE IS NOT YOURS TO EDIT. It came with the starter, and it builds the
# archive exactly the way the marking harness expects to receive it.
#
# Run it with:   make submit
#
# It does four things you would otherwise have to get right by hand:
#   1. names the zip            comp310-A4-<yourlastname>.zip
#   2. puts everything under    submission/
#   3. keeps your scripts executable
#   4. leaves out editor and system clutter
#
# IT ALWAYS BUILDS. If your work is unfinished it says so and builds anyway -
# submit what you have. Partial work in the right shape is marked; a missing
# submission is not.
#
# Read it if you want to -- it is plain `sh`. Nothing in it is hidden from you.
