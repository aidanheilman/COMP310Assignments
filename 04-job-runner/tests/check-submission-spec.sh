# COMP 310 - Week 4 - submission specification check
#
# THIS FILE IS NOT YOURS TO EDIT. It came with the starter, and it is the same
# check your work is put through after you submit it. Change your own files
# until this passes; changing this file changes nothing that counts.
#
# This checks the SHAPE of your submission, not whether your code is right.
# `make test` will not pass until both are in order, which is deliberate: work
# that does not meet its stated interface is not finished.
#
# Read it if you want to -- it is plain `sh`, and it is the specification in
# the handout written out as commands. Nothing in it is hidden from you.
